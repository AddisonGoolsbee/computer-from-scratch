The Game

You are a snake (a collection of squares), and you have one goal: eat food (circles). You'll start out as a single square, but with every piece of food you eat, you'll become one square longer. You die if you hit a wall or hit yourself.


Controls

Use the arrow keys to move. You can't move backwards (if you're moving right, you can't go left)
